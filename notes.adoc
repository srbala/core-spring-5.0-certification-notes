Core Spring 5.0 Certification Study Guide JANUARY 2018



## Overview

This guide is designed to help you prepare for the Core Spring 5.0 certification exams.  

The list of topics can be used as a check-list. The training materials can be used as a point of 
reference and as a learning ground. The list of resources is where you can go further for 
getting answers. Everything in the exam is covered somewhere in the course notes.

One possible way to prepare is to do the following for a given training module:

1. Review the slides, making notes of questions

2. Work through the labs

3. Review the list of topics that matches to the module by subject area

4. Use the lab to experiment with anything you need to spend more time on

5. Use the provided list of resources to look for further answers

6. Reading (at least partially) the reference documentation

7. Memorize the "big pictures", tables, overviews, etc

Of course there are many more ways to organize your efforts. You can pair up with someone 
else planning to take the exam or review all presentations for a given subject area before 
going through the labs. Or maybe you have access to actual applications you can review to 
test your knowledge. 

Please keep in mind that you are expected to have good working knowledge of all the topics
listed. Most of the questions will be very general, however you will be asked a few advanced
questions.

## Logistics

When you are ready to test and validate your product knowledge, please 
visit pivotal.io/training/certification to purchase an industry-recognized Pivotal certification 
exam.

Pivotal partners with Exams Local to remotely proctor our exams. Our certification exams may 
be taken from a location of your choosing anywhere in the world provided you can meet 
the basic system and test environment requirements and have a valid form of photo 
identification.

## The Exam
The exam itself is a computer-based exam. The exam software first gives you some general instructions: how to navigate, how to mark a question, and so forth - please read it carefully.

Once you have agreed that you want to start, you have 90 minutes to answer 50 multiple-choice questions. You must answer 38 questions correctly (76%) in order to pass the exam. 

Basic exam technique applies: read each question carefully and answer the question that was asked not what you thought was asked.

In particular the questions refer to pure Spring Framework without Spring Boot, unless the question explicitly says Spring Boot is involved.

The following is a list of topics, each of which is likely to have questions on the exam.

Several of the bullet points below overlap, asking the same (or a related) question in a 
different way. The answer to more than one bullet point question may be the same as the 
answer to another question just before or after. Don't let this confuse you.

## Exam FAQ

1. Is there anything in the exam, which was not covered in the course?
Mostly no.  BUT please note that @Secured and the Spring Security JSP tag library 
may be referenced in the exam and are not in the main course notes.

2. Do I have to know class names and method signatures?
No. We think that this is why you are using an IDE - for us it's much more important 
that you've understood the concepts rather than learning API and method signatures.

3. Do I have to write, complete or rearrange source code?
No. The only thing you should be able to do is read a snippet of code and understand 
what it's doing. For example, we might show you a class implementing a Spring 
callback and you will then see a couple of related questions. We do not ask you 
questions on things an IDE can do for you, like checking if the code will compile.

4. Do I have to know any other APIs like AspectJ expression language in detail?
No. Of course you should be able to read, understand and use AspectJ expression 

http://pivotal.io/training/faq/certification
https://www.examslocal.com/ScheduleExam/Home/CompatibilityCheck
http://pivotal.io/training/certification

language (pointcut expressions) wherever it is necessary to configure Spring AOP – 
but this is not an exam about AspectJ.

5. Are the advanced slides part of the exam?

No. Only the content presented before each chapter lab slide will be on the exam. Any 
course content presented after the chapter lab will not be in the exam. No content from
the optional chapters will be on the exam.
